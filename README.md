# PHP Authentication System with OTP Verification

This project is a simple web application developed using PHP, HTML, and CSS, implementing a login and registration system with the additional feature of OTP (One-Time Password) verification during the login process. Users can register for an account, log in with their credentials along with OTP sent to their email, and also update their information. Form validation is implemented to ensure data integrity and security.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create a new account by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password.
- **User Login with OTP**: Provides a secure login mechanism for registered users. OTP is sent to the user's email address for additional verification during login.
- **User Profile Update**: Allows users to update their information such as username, email, and password.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that input data is validated to prevent common security vulnerabilities and maintain data integrity.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Used for server-side scripting to handle user authentication, form processing, and database interactions.
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages and defining the content.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the user interface and enhancing the visual appeal.
- **MySQL**: Used as the backend database management system to store user information securely.
- **XAMPP**: Used as the local development environment, providing Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP interpreter.
